#### Main Theme - Daniel Licht - Dishonored

A mountainous country set in the middle of the DEFEY continent, famous for its mile deep mines and rich ores. The country's government keeps a tight clasp on the mining infrastructure, making sure no outsiders or unknowns get in and take the strange, precious ores.
From these mines, they get all their metals- and other strange substances, too. Lakes of strange molten liquid, and pure crystals of strange origins. 

In the early days, the miners discovered these crystals. But inside of them...were people. People frozen in time, inside these sharp crystals. They looked strange, almost inhuman. *Who, or what are these?* They wondered. Breaking the crystals down, they discovered they were seemingly just people- people trapped in crystal for whatever strange reason. 
The only thing strange about these people was that crystals ran down their spine, and sometimes, through one of their arms. Something about them wasn't natural. 

And then they disappeared. To the common folk, they're but a myth. But to the learned historian, they exist- and are still hiding. Why they decided to disappear remains a mystery, but perhaps they knew something the country didn't.

Being a landlocked country, Fayra gets its imports from the eastern coastal country, Abis. It exports an estimated ~50% of its ores to other countries in addition to whatever crops can be made, in the sparse flat areas where farming is optimal. 

Human & dwarves live in this country primarily. Its government is a strange conglomerate of the two, and they work together to keep the mining industry alive and well. 

Fayra's capital is FYRA, a dominant fortress built for war.

#### Salutations - Simon Chylinski - Subnautica

A coastal country focused on fishing and seafaring. Every town here is connected to a river, which goes straight to the sea. It acts as a haven for anybody and everybody, no matter who you are. Unlike Fayra, it feels bright and welcoming, and the sun shines constantly- though its storms are rough. The capital, Hisees, is on the waterfront - and extends itself partly into the water. Half floating city, half land market, it acts as the main trading centre for incoming countries from another continent. Miles large, its ports house hundreds, if not thousands of ships. Not all seafaring vessels are here for any good reasons, though.

Pirates are the main driving force behind black market deals in Abis, hiding in the shadows and trading illegal weapons, ores, or anything they can get their hands on. This doesn't mean they work well with each other, though. Some pirates work to break down the doors to these deals and put a stop to them- so they can have the items for themselves. 

It is a massive headache for the Abis government, which works tirelessly to put an end to piracy.

Aside from the mainland capital, there are underwater cities just off the coast. These aren't known to most people- only those who breathe underwater.
