# FAYRA

A mountainous country set in the middle of the DEFEY continent, famous for its mile deep mines and rich ores. The country's government keeps a tight clasp on the mining infrastructure, making sure no outsiders or unknowns get in and take the strange, precious ores.
From these mines, they get all their metals- and other strange substances, too. Lakes of strange molten liquid, and pure crystals of strange origins. 

In the early days, the miners discovered these crystals. But inside of them...were people. People frozen in time, inside these sharp crystals. They looked strange, almost inhuman. *Who, or what are these?* They wondered. Breaking the crystals down, they discovered they were seemingly just people- people trapped in crystal for whatever strange reason. 
The only thing strange about these people was that crystals ran down their spine, and sometimes, through one of their arms. Something about them wasn't natural. 

And then they disappeared. To the common folk, they're but a myth. But to the learned historian, they exist- and are still hiding. Why they decided to disappear remains a mystery, but perhaps they knew something the country didn't.

Being a landlocked country, Fayra gets its imports from the eastern coastal country, Abis. It exports an estimated ~50% of its ores to other countries in addition to whatever crops can be made, in the sparse flat areas where farming is optimal. 

Human & dwarves live in this country primarily. Its government is a strange conglomerate of the two, which one might think results in disaster, but it seems to stay afloat.
